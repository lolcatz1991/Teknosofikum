                During 2020-2023 we develop a ground-breaking research-based
                online concept and course on technology education for Higher
                Education (HE) teachers in Denmark. We call this Teknosofikum.

                Nationally and internationally, across the educational system,
                technology education (i.e. technology comprehension,
                computational empowerment, informatics, technological
                imagination – the baby has many names) is increasingly becoming
                acknowledged as central for all students
